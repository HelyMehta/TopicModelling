Several large studies have demonstrated a strong association between the radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat primary cancer and the risk of developing SMNs. However, for any given therapeutic exposure, the risk of developing an SMN varies between individuals. Genomic variation can potentially modify the association between therapeutic exposures and SMN risk and may explain the observed interindividual variability. In this review, the author provides a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of genomic variation in the development of therapy-related SMNs and discusses the methodological challenges in undertaking an endeavor to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of therapy-related SMNs, such as an appropriate study design, the identification of an adequately sized study population together with a reliable plan for collecting and maintaining high-quality DNA, clinical validation of the phenotype, and the selection of an appropriate approach or platform for genotyping. Understanding the factors that can modify the risk of treatment-related SMNs is critical to developing targeted intervention strategies and optimizing risk-based health care for cancer survivors.'], ['Genetic Risk for Subsequent Neoplasms Among Long-Term Survivors of Childhood Cancer.', 'Purpose Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of subsequent neoplasms (SNs), but the germline genetic contribution is largely unknown. We assessed the contribution of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations in cancer predisposition genes to their SN risk. Patients and Methods Whole-genome sequencing (30-fold) was performed on samples from childhood cancer survivors who were ≥ 5 years since initial cancer diagnosis and participants in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Germline mutations in 60 genes known to be associated with autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndromes with moderate to high penetrance were classified by their pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Relative rates (RRs) and 95% CIs of SN occurrence by mutation status were estimated using multivariable piecewise exponential regression stratified by radiation exposure. Results Participants were 3,006 survivors (53% male; median age, 35.8 years [range, 7.1 to 69.8 years]; 56% received radiotherapy), 1,120 SNs were diagnosed among 439 survivors (14.6%), and 175 P/LP mutations were identified in 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0% to 6.7%) of survivors. Mutations were associated with significantly increased rates of breast cancer (RR, 13.9; 95% CI, 6.0 to 32.2) and sarcoma (RR, 10.6; 95% CI, 4.3 to 26.3) among irradiated survivors and with increased rates of developing any SN (RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.3), breast cancer (RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 24.4), nonmelanoma skin cancer (RR, 11.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 41.4), and two or more histologically distinct SNs (RR, 18.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 99.3) among nonirradiated survivors. Conclusion The findings support referral of all survivors for genetic counseling for potential clinical genetic testing, which should be prioritized for nonirradiated survivors with any SN and for those with breast cancer or sarcoma in the field of prior irradiation.'], ['Elevated Risk of Radiation Therapy-Associated Second Malignant Neoplasms in Young African-American Women Survivors of Stage I-IIIA Breast Cancer.', StringElement('To estimate the effect of radiation therapy (RT) on nonbreast second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in young women survivors of stage I-IIIA breast cancer.', attributes={'Label': 'PURPOSE'})], ['Risk of subsequent primary neoplasms in survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study): a population-based, cohort study.', StringElement('Few studies have investigated the risks of subsequent primary neoplasms after adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer.

To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants, we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germline <i>TP53</i> variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germline <i>TP53</i> in 37 pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without any history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs.<b>Results:</b> WES revealed <i>TP53</i> mutations involving p53's DNA-binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somatic <i>TP53-</i>mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis of <i>TP53-</i>coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in 6 patients and a synonymous SNP A639G in 4 others, resulting in 10 of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germline <i>TP53</i> variant.<b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, germline <i>TP53</i> is not routinely assessed in patients with pediatric cancer. These data support the concept that identifying germline <i>TP53</i> variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive posttreatment monitoring. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(7); 1852-61. ©2016 AACR</i>.\"], ['Suicide risk among cancer survivors: Head and neck versus other cancers.', StringElement('Cancer survivors face psychosocial issues that increase their risk of suicide.

We evaluated the long-term risk of SMNs in a well-characterized cohort of 5-year CCSs, with a particular focus on individual chemotherapeutic agents and solid cancer risk. Methods The Dutch Childhood Cancer Oncology Group-Long-Term Effects After Childhood Cancer cohort includes 6,165 5-year CCSs diagnosed between 1963 and 2001 in the Netherlands. SMNs were identified by linkages with the Netherlands Cancer Registry, the Dutch Pathology Registry, and medical chart review. We calculated standardized incidence ratios, excess absolute risks, and cumulative incidences. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to evaluate treatment-associated risks for breast cancer, sarcoma, and all solid cancers. Results After a median follow-up of 20.7 years (range, 5.0 to 49.8 years) since first diagnosis, 291 SMNs were ascertained in 261 CCSs (standardized incidence ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.6 to 5.8; excess absolute risk, 20.3/10,000 person-years). Cumulative SMN incidence at 25 years after first diagnosis was 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4% to 4.6%) and did not change noticeably among CCSs treated in the 1990s compared with those treated earlier. We found dose-dependent doxorubicin-related increased risks of all solid cancers ( P<sub>trend</sub> < .001) and breast cancer ( P<sub>trend</sub> < .001). The doxorubicin-breast cancer dose response was stronger in survivors of Li-Fraumeni syndrome-associated childhood cancers (leukemia, CNS, and non-Ewing sarcoma) versus survivors of other cancers ( P<sub>difference</sub> = .008). In addition, cyclophosphamide was found to increase sarcoma risk in a dose-dependent manner ( P<sub>trend</sub> = .01).

In cancer samples, hundreds of novel frequent missense and nonsense variations in virostatic genes were identified, and variant genes failed to regulate their viral and cellular targets in cancer. For example, one-third of patients with EBV<sup>+</sup> NK/T-cell lymphoma carried two novel nonsense variants (Q322X, G342X) of <i>LMP1</i> and both variant proteins failed to restrict viral reactivation, confirming loss of virostatic function. Host cell transcriptional changes in response to EBV infection classified tumors into two molecular subtypes based on patterns of IFN signature genes and immune checkpoint markers, such as PD-L1 and IDO1. Overall, these findings uncover novel points of interaction between a common oncovirus and the human genome and identify novel regulatory nodes and druggable targets for individualized EBV and cancer-specific therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a comprehensive map of the host cell-pathogen interactome in EBV<sup>+</sup> malignancies.<i>See related commentary by Mbulaiteye and Prokunina-Olsson, p. 5917</i>.'], ['Risk factors of advanced metachronous neoplasms in surveillance after colon cancer resection.', StringElement('Regular surveillance colonoscopy after colon cancer resection is recommended for detecting metachronous adenoma and cancer.

Ethnic density, defined as the proportion of racial/ethnic minority individuals residing in a given geographic area, is 1 of the most frequently studied social environment factors, but studies on ethnic density and cancer have yielded inconsistent findings. Thus, the objective of the current review was to summarize the extant data on ethnic density and cancer-related outcomes (cancer risk, stage at diagnosis, and mortality) with the aim of identifying pathways by which ethnic density may contribute to outcomes across populations. In general, the findings indicated an association between ethnic density and increased risk for cancers of infectious origin (eg, liver, cervical) but lower risk for breast and colorectal cancers, particularly among Hispanic and Asian Americans. Hispanic ethnic density was associated with greater odds of late-stage cancer diagnosis, whereas black ethnic density was associated with greater mortality. In addition, this review highlights several methodological and conceptual issues surrounding the measurement of ethnic neighborhoods and their available resources. Clarifying the role of neighborhood ethnic density is critical to developing a greater understanding of the health risks and benefits accompanying these environments and how they may affect racial and ethnic disparities in cancer-related outcomes.

Because meaning and purpose are often threatened by a cancer diagnosis and treatment, interventions have been developed to promote meaning and purpose. The present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated effects of psychosocial interventions on meaning/purpose in adults with cancer and tested potential moderators of intervention effects. Six literature databases were systematically searched to identify RCTs of psychosocial interventions in which meaning or purpose was an outcome. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, rater pairs extracted and evaluated data for quality. Findings were synthesized across studies with standard meta-analytic methods, including meta-regression with robust variance estimation and risk-of-bias sensitivity analysis. Twenty-nine RCTs were identified, and they encompassed 82 treatment effects among 2305 patients/survivors. Psychosocial interventions were associated with significant improvements in meaning/purpose (g\\xa0=\\xa00.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.52; P\\xa0<\\xa0.0001).

Cells are constantly assaulted by both exogenous and endogenous stimuli leading to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidation of the nucleotide dGTP to 8-oxodGTP. If this base is incorporated into DNA and goes unrepaired, it can result in G\\u202f>\\u202fT transversions, leading to genomic DNA damage. MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1) is a nucleoside diphosphate X (Nudix) pyrophosphatase that can remove 8-oxodGTP from the nucleotide pool before it is incorporated into DNA by hydrolyzing it into 8-oxodGMP. MTH1 expression has been shown to be elevated in many cancer cells and is thought to be a survival mechanism by which a cancer cell can stave off the effects of high ROS that can result in cell senescence or death. It has recently become a target of interest in cancer because it is thought that inhibiting MTH1 can increase genotoxic damage and cytotoxicity. Determining the role of MTH1 in normal and cancer cells is confounded by an inability to reliably and directly measure its native enzymatic activity. We have used the chimeric ATP-releasing guanine-oxidized (ARGO) probe that combines 8-oxodGTP and ATP to measure MTH1 enzymatic activity in colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) along with patient-matched normal tissue. MTH1 8-oxodGTPase activity is significantly increased in tumors across all three tissue types, indicating that MTH1 is a marker of cancer. MTH1 activity measured by ARGO assay was compared to mRNA and protein expression measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot in the CRC tissue pairs, revealing a positive correlation between ARGO assay and Western blot, but little correlation with RT-qPCR in these samples.

One shortcoming of traditional cancer classification systems is that, even for tumors affecting a single organ, there is significant molecular heterogeneity. Precise molecular classification of tumors could be beneficial in personalizing patients' therapy and predicting prognosis. To this end, here we propose to use molecular signatures to further refine cancer classification. Molecular signatures are collections of genes characterizing particular cell types, tissues or disease. Signatures can be used to interpret expression profiles from heterogeneous samples. Large collections of gene signatures have previously been cataloged in the MSigDB database. We have developed a web-based Signature Visualization Tool (SaVanT) to display signature scores in user-generated expression data. Here we have undertaken a systematic analysis of correlations between inflammatory signatures and cancer samples, to test whether inflammation can differentiate cancer types. Inflammatory response signatures were obtained from MsigDB and SaVanT and a signature score was computed for samples associated with 7 different cancer types. We first identified types of cancers that had high inflammation levels as measured by these signatures. The correlation between signature scores and metadata of these patients (sex, age at initial cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, and vital status) was then computed. We sought to evaluate correlations between inflammation with other clinical parameters and identified four cancer types that had statistically significant association (p-value < 0.05) with at least one clinical characteristic: pancreas adenocarcinoma (PAAD), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), kidney chromophobe (KICH), and uveal melanoma (UVM).

We used convenience sampling to recruit 80 study participants already enrolled in longitudinal studies of breast and prostate cancers at a tertiary hospital in Soweto between June and August 2017. This included 50 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 30 men diagnosed with prostate cancer; three-quarters of the sample had two or more comorbidities, including HIV, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, and others. Many described sickness in terms of any physical ill-health that affected daily routines, but rarely was it associated exclusively with a specific disease. Men and women described more fear associated with cancer than HIV or hypertension-two of the most common diseases. We found that this may be in part a reflection of how people feared and demonized their cancer diagnoses, calling it \"a demon!\", and framing cancer through the trauma of aggressive treatments like chemotherapy (\"the red devil!\") and physical disfiguration from mastectomy.

This review examines biobehavioral risk factors linked to fatigue and the mechanisms through which they influence fatigue across the cancer continuum, with a focus on neuro-immune processes. Among psychosocial risk factors, childhood adversity is a strong and consistent predictor of cancer-related fatigue; other risk factors include history of depression, catastrophizing, lack of physical activity, and sleep disturbance, with compelling preliminary evidence for loneliness and trait anxiety. Among biologic systems, initial work suggests that alterations in immune, neuroendocrine, and neural processes are associated with fatigue.

Four patients had a known history of breast cancer (remote in 3 and concurrent in 1), but the metastases (3 liver, 1 lung) labeled for chromogranin and/or synaptophysin, prompting misdiagnosis as neuroendocrine neoplasm. In a fifth case, a liver metastasis in a patient with a known pancreatic endocrine neoplasm was originally thought to be of pancreatic origin; an occult concurrent primary breast cancer (PBC) was subsequently identified as the source. On further immunohistochemistry (IHC), all metastases evaluated were diffusely, strongly positive for estrogen receptor (5/5 cases) and GATA3 (4/4 cases). Three patients had previously received ineffective treatment for neuroendocrine carcinoma. Based on the consultation diagnosis, all 4 patients with follow-up received hormone therapy, which was effective in 3.

The average age of cancer incidence in different regions, gender and cancer sites were analyzed and stratified according to the human development Index and the level of national or regional development UN Development. The Segi's world standard population (world standard) was standardized to calculate the average age of the cancer incidence and to analyze the effect of age structure of the population on the average age of cancer diagnosis. <b>Results:</b> This study included 4 812 008 148 person-years in the global population (including 2 367 458 302 men and 2 444 549 846 women), and 21 892 093 of the new cancer cases, including 11 450 515 men and 10 441 578 women. The analysis showed that the average age of cancer incidence in the world was 65.73 years, and men and women were 66.70 and 64.67 years old, respectively. Among them, the average incidence age of testicular cancer was the youngest, with an average age of 36.67 years, and that of gallbladder cancer was the highest with average age of 71.55 years. After adjusting for population structure, the average incidence age was highest in gallbladder cancer, followed with bladder cancer and prostate cancer, and the testicular was with the lowest average age of incidence, followed by bone cancer and brain tumor. The results showed that the average age of cancer incidence in developed countries or regions was 66.38 years old, and that in less developed countries or regions was 61.75 years old, but in China it was 63.47 years old. According to the human development index (HDI), the higher the country or region with HDI, the higher the average age of cancer incidence, and the difference is reduced after the adjustment of the age structure of the population. <b>Conclusions:</b> There are different characteristics of the age distribution for different cancer sites. In terms of the age of cancer incidence, those of gallbladder cancer and bladder cancer are relatively old, while those of the testis, bone and thyroid cancer are relatively young. The average age of cancer incidence in China is between developed and less developed countries.
